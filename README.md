# rangan_flappy

This simple game is dedicated to my friend Rangan who was working in dell and couldn't find an admit in Computer Science because of his prior background in Electronics.

In this game, if you manage to win you will get Rangan (an admit) and then a("winner winner chicken dinner") screen will play followed by Mario music which was inspired by the games PUBG and Super Mario.

An extension of the problem could be to play the function that causes graphics and the other function that plays a sound to be multi-threaded to end at the same time, so the display and the sound go altogether.

The idea behind the code is to use concepts of Iot and connecting various sensors on the board to work together
connected sensors- speaker,push buttons,lcd screen , lots of jumper wires, bread board and some led to know that the current is flowing.

Note- if you want to play the sound that you want , you need to convert that sound on a midi file or directly download the midi version , then there are many midi to arduino converter that you can use to convert them into a tone function.
now put them all in a function called sound and then call this function to play those sounds

you can also add any custom strings , if you dont like the classic # example - your boss's name :) (If you don't like your boss)

finaly have fun making this and editing the code, sorry i couldn't provide the frizing board diagram for circuits used but will surely provide it , next time
